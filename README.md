## My Submissions
1. [Ideamarket.io User Engagement](https://duneanalytics.com/masquot/ideamarket-user-engagement)
2. [Ideamarket.io Exchange](https://duneanalytics.com/masquot/ideamarket-io-exchange)
3. [Ideamarket.io Social Accounts](https://duneanalytics.com/masquot/ideamarket-io-social-accounts)

## My Hackathon Experience
I have created dashboards in a previous career. These are my first dashboards implemented off smart contracts.

It was a fun and rewarding experience. The ideamarket team created great documentation. This helped me a lot. Dune Analytics is intuitive to use and powerful.

## Demo Video

This is my first ever screencast, so please have patience with me! Also, I had to use the built-in mic of my laptop, so apologies in advance for bad sound quality.

You can find my demo video on [odysee](https://odysee.com/@masquot:8/ideamarket-dune-analytics-dashboards:4).

## What's Next?
* If I can make tweaks to the dashboards that will enhance your use experience, please let me know and I will implement them. :)
